ChapterConverter

Currently only usable if you use the exact same template as I use for my chapters on snypso.com, and if you use the same css files, and you only have one chapter in your yWriter txt file exprort(and didn't export it with extra information about the scene etc.)..

Will try to update it when I get so far as to need extended features my self.
